        <p>
            Hello! <br/> My name is Gabriella Andino and I am a young
            women discovering software development. When I am not tied to my
            computer I like to cook and try new things. I am facinated at
            how beautiful food can be. I also really love animals and hope
            to work remotely one day from a farm full of cows, horses, dogs
            cats, ect.. really anything with four legs and is cute. I
            currently live in rainy Seattle and work as a barista at a local
            bagel shop. My favorite color is red and I am obsessed with cow print
            items. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I would really like to get a job in software development in order
            to work remote. I love traveling and I want to visit multiple countries
            and see the world through my eyes instead of online pictures.
            I want to own multiple homes and have lots of animals.
